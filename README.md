# DialoGPT Chatbot 🤖

A conversational AI chatbot built with Microsoft's DialoGPT model and Gradio interface. It's like having a friend who never gets tired of talking... and occasionally thinks it's a pirate! 🏴‍☠️

## Demo Screenshots

Here's what the chatbot interface looks like in action (no coffee breaks needed! ☕):

*The chatbot's clean and modern interface - No, it doesn't do dark mode because it's afraid of the dark* 🌚

![Chat Example](example/Screenshot%202025-05-13%20133221.png)
*Example of a conversation with the AI - It's trying its best to sound human, but sometimes it's more entertaining than GPT-4... which isn't saying much* 😅

*Showcasing the chatbot's response capabilities - Yes, it's thinking. No, it's not planning world domination* 🌍

## Features

- Interactive chat interface (Smoother than your morning coffee! ☕)
- Powered by DialoGPT-medium model (The "medium" stands for "medium rare" - just kidding, it's AI!)
- Real-time responses (Faster than your friend texting back)
- Modern web interface (No Windows 95 aesthetics here!)
- Example conversation starters (Because "Hello World" is so 1970s)
- Memory of conversation context (Better than a goldfish! 🐠)

## Technical Details

- **Model**: Microsoft DialoGPT-medium (It's not small, it's not large, it's juuuust right 🥄)
- **Framework**: Gradio (Making UIs pretty since... well, recently!)
- **Language**: Python 3.x (Because Python 2 is so last decade)
- **Dependencies**: PyTorch, Transformers, Gradio (The three musketeers of AI)

## Configuration

The chatbot's response generation can be customized by adjusting these parameters in `chatbot.py`:

- `temperature`: Controls randomness (0.8 by default - spicy, but not too spicy! 🌶️)
- `top_p`: Controls diversity (0.7 by default - perfectly balanced, as all things should be)
- `top_k`: Controls vocabulary size (100 by default - it knows more words than your average parrot! 🦜)
- `max_length`: Maximum response length (1000 by default - brevity is... well, not our strong suit)

## FAQ

Q: Will this chatbot pass the Turing test?
A: Let's just say it's more likely to pass a comedy test! 😄

Q: Can it write my homework?
A: Nice try! It's more likely to write a haiku about why you should do it yourself! 📚

Q: Is it self-aware?
A: Only of its own jokes, which are questionable at best! 🎭
